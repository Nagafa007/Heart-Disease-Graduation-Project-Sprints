## 📋 Overview
This project uses the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to predict the severity of heart disease across five levels (0–4).  
It covers the complete ML pipeline, including:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Dimensionality reduction and feature selection  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning methods  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- A Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
